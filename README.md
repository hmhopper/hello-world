# hello-world

I'm a beginning coder.I'm currently a musician, nightime childcare provider, and a secretary for a university IT department. I have a lot of free time during the day, so I was inspired to learn a little bit of coding, in keeping with my surroundings. I can't wait to see how the next few months/years will challenge me to learn new things!
